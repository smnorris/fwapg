-- Given blue_line_key and downstream_route_measure, return a (potentially
-- modified) FWA watershed with:
-- - wscode_ltree
-- - localcode_ltree
-- - area_ha
-- - refine_method - for the 1st order watershed in which the point lies:
--     CUT  - point is on a river/canal, cut the input watersheds at point
--     DEM  - point is on a single line stream,further DEM refinement needed
--     DROP - point is on single line stream and close enough to top of the
--            first order watershed that retaining the first order watershed
--            is not necessary
--     KEEP - point is on single line stream and close enough to bottom of the
--            first order watershed that the entire first order watershed is
--            retained  (no further refining necessary)
--     LAKE - point is in a lake/non-canal reservoir, simply return watershed
--            upstream of the outlet
-- - geom


-- TODO - what happens if cut returns an invalid geometry?
