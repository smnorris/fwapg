fwapg
=================================

``fwapg`` extends British Columbia's `Freshwater Atlas <https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/topographic-data/freshwater>`_ (FWA) with PostgreSQL/PostGIS. ``fwapg`` provides additional tables, indexes and functions to:

- quickly translate arbitrary point locations (``X,Y``) to a linear reference positions (``blue_line_key, measure``) on the stream network
- enable speedy upstream/downstream queries throughout BC
- quickly and cleanly generate watershed boundaries upstream of arbitrary locations
- enable cross-boundary queries by combining FWA data with data from neighbouring jurisdictions
- enable querying of FWA features via spatial SQL
- provide ``gradient`` values for every FWA stream
- enable quickly serving FWA features as vector tiles (MVT) via ``pg_tileserv``
- enable quickly serving FWA features and custom fwapg functions via ``pg_featureserv``
