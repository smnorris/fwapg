## fwa_assessment_watersheds_lut

Some workflows require relating `fwa_assessment_watersheds_poly` to fundamental watersheds. There are no existing keys in the data that maintain this link - the query requires a resource intensive spatial function.  Rather than running a spatial query every time, this lookup is provided.

## fwa_assessment_watersheds_streams_lut

Some workflows require relating `fwa_assessment_watersheds_poly` to stream segments. There are no existing keys in the data that maintain this link - the query requires a resource intensive spatial function.  Rather than running a spatial query every time, this lookup is provided.

| `watershed_feature_id` | `integer` | FWA fundamental watershed unique identifer |


## fwa_waterbodies

All FWA waterbodies in one table for convenience (lakes, wetlands, rivers, manmade waterbodies, glaciers). 
Note that this table is meant for connectivity purposes only, only features connected to the network are included (waterbodies with watershed code  `999.999999` are excluded). For column descriptions see FWA docs for the various waterbody tables.

| Column | Type | Description |

## fwa_waterbodies_upstream_area

A lookup storing area of lake/reservoir/wetland upstream of individual stream segments.
Note that this table differs from `fwa_watersheds_upstream_area` noted above - we use streams as the lookup base rather than watersheds because waterbodies can be nested within fundamental watersheds.

**NOTE** - output currently includes area upstream **WITHIN BC ONLY**, this will not be accurate in watersheds that have contributing drainage outside of BC!

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| linear_feature_id     | bigint           |           |
| upstream_lake_ha      | double precision |           |
| upstream_reservoir_ha | double precision |           |
| upstream_wetland_ha   | double precision |           |

## fwa_watersheds_upstream_area

Area upstream (ha) for all fundamental watersheds as a lookup table. Area *includes* the area of the fundamental watershed indicated by the id.

**NOTE** - output currently includes area upstream **WITHIN BC ONLY**, this will not be accurate in watersheds that have contributing drainage outside of BC!

When working with watersheds, join to this lookup directly via `watershed_feature_id`.
When working with streams, relate the streams to watersheds via the lookup `fwa_streams_watersheds_lut`:

    SELECT
      s.linear_feature_id,
      ua.upstream_area_ha
    FROM whse_basemapping.fwa_stream_networks_sp s
    LEFT OUTER JOIN whse_basemapping.fwa_streams_watersheds_lut l
    ON s.linear_feature_id = l.linear_feature_id
    INNER JOIN whse_basemapping.fwa_watersheds_upstream_area ua
    ON l.watershed_feature_id = ua.watershed_feature_id

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| watershed_feature_id | integer          | |
| upstream_area_ha     | double precision | |


## psf.pse_conservation_units_streams

Lookup relating Pacific Salmon Explorer Conservation Units to FWA streams

|      Column       |  Type   | Description |
--------------------|---------|-----------  |
| linear_feature_id | bigint  |             |  
| cuid              | integer |             |  


For example, to find length of all streams associated with CU 289 (Morice) and CU 287 (Bulkley):

```
  SELECT
    cu.cuid,
    round((sum(st_length(s.geom)) / 1000)::numeric, 2) AS length_km
  FROM whse_basemapping.fwa_streams_vw s
  JOIN psf.pse_conservation_units_streams cu USING (linear_feature_id)
  WHERE cu.cuid IN (289, 287)
  GROUP BY cu.cuid;

 cuid | length_km
------+-----------
  287 |   9371.21
  289 |  11534.82

   
  
```
