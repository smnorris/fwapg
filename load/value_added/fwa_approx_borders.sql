-- fwa_approx_borders.sql

-- For watersheds queries, we want to know if a given location is
-- on a stream that is about to leave BC. Find these streams by intersecting
-- with these lines along the border.
-- Borders should match the FWA boundaries (using the surveyed BC boundary
-- does not work for this application because it does not follow the
-- lat 49/6 lon 120 that the FWA generally follows)

-- NOTES
-- - this does not include Alaska
-- - does not attempt to define continental divide
-- - it could be valuable to manually QA results of intersection of these
--   lines and streams and generate a lookup of all BC streams that exit the
--   province rather than approximating in this way. We could also presumably
--   query to find streams that end where measure != 0
